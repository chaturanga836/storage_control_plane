# ðŸ”§ DEPLOY SCRIPT FIX SUMMARY

## Issue Fixed
The `deploy_ec2.sh` script had a logic error where it would fail when run from inside the `storage_control_plane` directory, which is the most natural way to run it.

## Root Causes
1. **Directory Navigation Logic**: Script always changed to `$HOME` directory first, then tried to detect if it was in the right place
2. **Hardcoded Paths**: Systemd service configuration used hardcoded paths like `$HOME/storage_control_plane`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Directory Detection Logic
**Before:**
```bash
cd $HOME
if [ "$(basename $(pwd))" = "storage_control_plane" ]; then
    # This would never work since we just cd'd to $HOME
```

**After:**
```bash
# Check current location first, THEN try other locations
if [ "$(basename $(pwd))" = "storage_control_plane" ]; then
    print_status "Already in storage_control_plane directory"
elif [ -d "storage_control_plane" ]; then
    cd storage_control_plane
else
    # Only try $HOME as last resort
    cd $HOME
    if [ -d "storage_control_plane" ]; then
        cd storage_control_plane
    else
        print_error "Directory not found..."
```

### 2. Fixed Systemd Service Paths
**Before:**
```bash
WorkingDirectory=$HOME/storage_control_plane
ExecStart=$HOME/storage_control_plane/storage-control-plane
EnvironmentFile=$HOME/storage_control_plane/.env
```

**After:**
```bash
CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)  # Get actual current directory
WorkingDirectory=$CURRENT_DIR
ExecStart=$CURRENT_DIR/storage-control-plane
EnvironmentFile=$CURRENT_DIR/.env
```

### 3. Updated Deployment Guide
- Added automated deployment section
- Clarified that script can be run from inside `storage_control_plane` directory
- Provided clear step-by-step instructions

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaturanga836/storage_control_plane.git
   cd storage_control_plane
   ```

2. **Run the fixed script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy_ec2.sh
   ./deploy_ec2.sh
   ```

3. **Verify it works from any location:**
   ```bash
   # Test from inside directory (most common)
   cd storage_control_plane
   ./deploy_ec2.sh
   
   # Test from parent directory  
   cd ..
   ./storage_control_plane/deploy_ec2.sh
   ```

## Benefits of the Fix
- âœ… Works when run from inside `storage_control_plane` directory (most natural)
- âœ… Works when run from parent directory
- âœ… Works when run from home directory
- âœ… Uses dynamic paths instead of hardcoded ones
- âœ… More robust error handling
- âœ… Better user experience

The script now properly detects the current location and adapts accordingly, making it much more user-friendly and robust.
